Course Manager App

A simple Flutter app to add, edit, delete, and view courses with full offline support.
Courses include a title, description, category, lessons count, and an auto-calculated score.
Categories are loaded from a mock API and cached for offline use.
The app features clean UI, search, filters, loading states, and empty states.
All data (courses + categories) is stored locally so the app works even without internet.
